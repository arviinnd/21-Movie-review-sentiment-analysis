Subject: use case on sentiment analysis using naive bayes classifier
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone,
<br>
<br>
We have been given a set of movie reviews split into training and test data with predicted sentiments for the reviews. We build a model 
using the Naive Bayes Classifier on the training data to predict the sentiments of the reviews. We then check the accuracy of the model 
by predicting the sentiments of the test data. The model gives an accuracy of 74 %.

<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
